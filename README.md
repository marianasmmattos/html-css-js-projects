## :pushpin: About

<p align="justify">
It's mostly a list with some projects that I liked and kept the code during my progression through self learning how to program. None of them was built from any tutorial, they're all my original ones. Here you can see the source code and the deployed versions.

Landing page built with ES6+, scss styles and github's API intergation, Node.js server. Most of the HTML content is created through javascript, I was inspired 'cause I was learning about js frameworks. Responsive and with dynamic background, no CSS frameworks involved. The data is my GH profile and I was worried of LightHouse's analysis. Portuguese description and content.
